A Smart Portal for Reporting Potholes & Road Safety Issues

### The Problem:

Roads are an important mode of transport in India. India has one of the largest road networks in the world, with about 59 lakh km of road length. With such a large network of roads in India, **Potholes** have become a major problem. There has been a significant increase in accidents that occur on the road because of these Potholes and road safety is very less,  since these life-threatening potholes never get filled. The risk of vehicular damage is also a concern. All this is because the government failed to maintain and repair roads. People tend to just live with these potholes, instead of reporting it.


### Our Solution:

An online platform can be developed where the masses can easily visualize and contribute to lowering the rate of these potholes. Here, people can easily report potholes, in a few simple steps and earn rewards for the same. While Google Maps has drastically improved in charting Indian roads, it still doesnâ€™t have information about dents and potholes in the road, neither does it provide you with a feature to report these problems directly to the government. This is what Beton is trying to overcome.

### Our Website:

We have made a very convenient and accessible website for the benefit of our users, the contractors, the advertisers and the admin.  There are 4 modules to our website:

- The User Side
- The Contractor Side
- The Advertiser Side
- The Admin side

Each of the 4 modules have their own Login/Signup page where, after entering their credentials, they can view their respective data.
